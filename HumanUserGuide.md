## Introduction

* Pronouns: they/them/theirs
* Born and raised in sunny Los Angeles!
* Multilingual and fluent in English, Tagalog, and Spanish!
* Before Github, I worked in production as an editor, cameraperson, and operations manager!
* In my free time I play a lot of video games and do crosswords :)

## Environment

* I love working remotely. It helps with my pacing throughout the day and I can work in my own comfort.
* Sometimes, when I don't have meetings in the day, I like to work in cafes for the ambience and to force my productivity.
* I always work until I feel like I've been productive. Whether that means working for two four hour blocks or one eight hour block.
* I love collaboration and am willing to meet with others at any time of the day in order to pick at eachothers minds!

## Communication & Feedback
* Love me some good constructive feedback! Be straightforward! I can take it!
* I'd rather ask too many questions than be confused on what I'm supposed to do.
* The quickest way to reach me is through Slack! It's easiest for async messages and quick questions, but I respond there fairly quickly.
* Next best way is to set up a meeting with me! I tend to be a social person so I love talking in real time with my coworkers if it means getting information quickly. I prefer to meet between 10am PST - 6pm PST, but am willing to meet earlier if I have prior notice!
* It would probably be quicker to send me a carrier pigeon than to send me an *email*

## Support
* Being neurodivergent, the biggest thing I can ask for is clear communication. Be straightforward with me, don't leave room for interpretation.
* I love sharing my experiences! Talk to me about: community engagement/management, video/photo editing, SEO, leadership, streaming, social media algorithms! 
* Aside from career experiences, I'm also an open book when it comes to personal experiences. Get to know me! Ask me things! I'm an avid advocate for when it comes to working with and managing mental illness, neurodivergency, disability, burnout, etc.
